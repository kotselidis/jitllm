/**
 * Host weights for the {@code qwen35} architecture.
 *
 * <p>Implements {@link Weights} directly rather than extending {@link StandardWeights}, because
 * that base class assumes every layer has a query, key and value projection. Here three layers in
 * four have none: they mix with a delta-net recurrence and carry an entirely different weight set.
 * Extending it would mean 48 nulls per array and a base class whose fields lie about the model.
 *
 * <p>Every per-layer array is nonetheless indexed by <b>absolute block index</b>, not by a per-kind
 * counter. An entry is {@code null} where the layer is of the other kind. That keeps the forward
 * pass reading {@code wq[l]} with the same {@code l} it uses everywhere else — a second, compacted
 * indexing is exactly the sort of off-by-one that produces fluent, wrong text.
 *
 * <p>The arrays are sized for {@link #blockCount} blocks: the trunk plus its MTP blocks, so an MTP
 * block's attention and feed-forward weights sit at their own index alongside the trunk's.
