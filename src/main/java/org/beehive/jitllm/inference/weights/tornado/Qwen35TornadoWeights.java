/**
 * Device weights for the {@code qwen35} architecture.
 *
 * <p>Extends {@link TornadoWeights} rather than implementing {@link Weights} directly, which is the
 * opposite of what the host {@code Qwen35StandardWeights} does. The reason is reach rather than
 * symmetry: {@code Activation}, {@code AbstractLogitsTaskGraph} and {@code TornadoForwardPass} are
 * written against {@code TornadoWeights}, and a family outside that type would need each of them
 * changed to accommodate it. Fitting the existing shape costs a documented convention; not fitting
 * it costs edits to shared classes for one family's benefit.
 *
 * <p>The base class's per-layer arrays are indexed by <b>absolute block index</b>, and are {@code
 * null} where the block is of the other kind:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code wqLayered}, {@code wkLayered}, {@code wvLayered}, {@code woLayered} — the attending
 *       blocks only, {@code null} at the 48 recurrent layers, whose mixer has no query, key or
 *       value projection at all. {@code wqLayered} is twice a query projection's width here,
 *       carrying an interleaved output gate.
 *   <li>{@code rms_att_weightLayered}, {@code rms_ffn_weightLayered}, {@code w1/w2/w3Layered} —
 *       every block, of either kind, because both mixers are followed by the same dense
 *       feed-forward. {@code rms_ffn_weightLayered} is the file's {@code post_attention_norm}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The recurrent layers' own weights are the fields below, indexed the same way and {@code null}
 * at the attending blocks. A second, compacted numbering would be the kind of off-by-one that
 * produces fluent, wrong text; the dense indices that do exist ({@code keyValueLayerIndex} and
 * {@code recurrentLayerIndex}) address <i>state</i>, not weights.
 *
 * <p>{@code weightType} is the representation the <b>projections</b> are retained in. It is not a
 * claim that every tensor here is that type — this model is mixed by construction, with Q5_K
 * recurrent outputs and a Q6_K vocabulary projection — and a layer graph dispatches per tensor.
