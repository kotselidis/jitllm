/**
 * The one place this process asks TornadoVM what it is running on.
 *
 * <p>Before this, four call sites asked independently — {@code LoweredPlanSelection}'s device label
 * for the cache key, {@code SchedulerDetectionService} for the scheduler type and two backend
 * predicates, {@code TensorCoreSupport} for MMA, and {@code JitllmBench} inline for a report
 * heading — and all four pinned {@code getBackend(0).getDefaultDevice()}. Four answers that must
 * agree, derived four times, is a disagreement waiting for a machine with two backends installed.
 *
 * <p><b>Resolved once, lazily, and cached.</b> That is not an optimization: a cache-key component
 * must not change underneath the cache. {@code LoweredPlanSelection} learned this the expensive way
 * — it used to read {@code System.getProperty("tornado.device")}, which TornadoVM sets while
 * initializing, so it read {@code "default"} before the first plan and {@code "0"} after, and the
 * same program keyed differently in the first session than in every later one. Asking the runtime
 * rather than the property, and asking once, is the fix.
 *
 * <p><b>No accelerator is a normal answer.</b> Resolution never throws: a machine without a device
 * gets a stable placeholder identity and an empty capability set, so a caller that only wants a
 * label for a log line does not have to handle an exception, and a program compiled without a
 * device is one nothing will execute anyway.

     *       written when NVIDIA devices arrived under a separate PTX backend; TornadoVM has since
     *       folded PTX into CUDA, so the test matched no device and the warp GEMVs were never
     *       selected. Granting it to CUDA is correct — the 11 CPU-parity cases pass either way —
     *       but measurably slower on the one device it was tried on (RTX 5090 Laptop, Qwen3-1.7B
     *       decode: 141 to 134 tok/s in FP16, 149 to 125 in Q8_0), so it stays off deliberately
     *       rather than by accident. The OpenCL backend is a separate matter: it compiles {@code
     *       KernelContext.simdShuffleDown} and computes the wrong answer, so it must never have
     *       this capability regardless of speed.
     *   <li><b>tensor-core MMA</b> — CUDA only; TornadoVM lowers the MMA intrinsics nowhere else.
     *   <li><b>packed integer dot</b> — CUDA, where the {@code dp4a} path was measured <i>and</i>
     *       where the warp shuffle the packed kernels reduce with is correct. The instruction is
     *       lowered on the other backends as well and its Java body is correct everywhere, so that
     *       half withholds a preference rather than a result; the reduction half does not, and is
     *       why this must never be granted on OpenCL.
     *   <li><b>split-KV attention</b> — everywhere except Metal, which fails to JIT {@code
     *       processHeadsFlashAttentionSplitKV}.
     *   <li><b>single-pass RMS</b> — the device half of the scheduler type: an NVIDIA platform.
     *       Elsewhere lowering emits an extra {@code *_rms_finalize} task per block. The model half
     *       of that decision is not a device fact and stays in {@code SchedulerDetectionService}.
     *   <li><b>shuffle-reduced FP16 GEMV</b> — CUDA, where the 32-lane butterfly is lowered
     *       correctly and checked by the per-family CPU-parity gates. A correctness grant; the
     *       preference that reads it is {@code Fp16GemvReductionPolicy}.
     *   <li><b>32-wide subgroup shuffle</b> — Metal only, and deliberately not the same grant as
     *       warp shuffle above: verified for exactly the fused Q/K/V projection kernel's five-step
     *       butterfly reduction (Metal parity task, {@code DeviceCapability.SUBGROUP_SHUFFLE_32}),
