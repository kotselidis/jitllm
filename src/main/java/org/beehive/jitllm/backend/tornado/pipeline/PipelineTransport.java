/**
 * How activations cross from one pipeline stage to the next, and how the stages run.
 *
 * <p>Two implementations: {@link HostTransport} copies through host memory and runs the stages one
 * after the other on the calling thread; {@code NcclTransport} sends device to device with NCCL and
 * runs every stage on its own thread through an {@code NcclPlanGroup}. The NCCL one is compiled
 * only with the {@code nccl} Maven profile, so it is loaded by name.
 *
 * <p>Send and receive are added to a graph the caller builds, so a stage can hand over several
 * buffers (the decode hidden state, a prefill chunk's) and a receiving graph can carry other
 * bindings as well.
