 * places where a row depends on the row before it. There the kernel scans the chunk itself, in
 * token order, one lane per convolution channel or per delta-net value column. See {@code
 * Qwen35BatchKernels} for why that is exact and why it makes the result independent of the chunk
 * size.
 *
 * <p>Every weight-reading task is still selected by that tensor's own representation, and the fused
 * gate/up task still requires its two operands to agree. Nothing is materialized for the batched
 * path that is not materialized for the single-token one, which is to say nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>Graph names are {@code batchLayer_i}, distinct from the decode graphs' {@code layer_i}: the
 * batched plan holds both families at once, and the decode ones consume what these produced.
