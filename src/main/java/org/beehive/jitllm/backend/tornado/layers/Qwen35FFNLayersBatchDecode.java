 * The decode layers of the batched plan.
 *
 * <p>The same graphs the single-token plan builds, with one difference at layer 0: the key/value
 * store, the block table and the recurrent state were allocated and filled by the batch-prefill
 * graphs, so this layer <b>consumes</b> them from the decode activation rather than uploading its
 * own. Uploading would give decode a second, empty copy of the sequence's history — the model would
 * answer as though the prompt had never been read.
 *
 * <p>The weights come the same way, from the batch-prefill graph for the same block: bound with a
 * transfer in both families, a plan would hold the whole model twice.
 *
 * <p><b>Several layers to a graph.</b> Decode submits one graph at a time and the host cost of a
 * submission does not scale with what the graph contains, so adjacent layers share a graph and the
 * number of submissions falls by that factor. The layers are still built in order and still
 * separate: each consumes its own weights from its own {@code batchLayer_} producer, and only the
 * graph's own edges — the activation it consumes and the state it persists — are taken once, by the
 * first and last layer in it. A final group with fewer layers left takes a smaller graph.
