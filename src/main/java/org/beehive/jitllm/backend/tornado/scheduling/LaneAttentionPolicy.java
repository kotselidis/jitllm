/**
 * Whether decode attention runs the lane-cooperative kernel instead of the per-key one.
 *
 * <p>Support and preference are kept apart here for the same reason they are in {@link
 * Fp16GemvReductionPolicy}. The support half is {@link DeviceCapability#SHUFFLE_REDUCED_FP16_GEMV}:
 * the kernel reduces with {@code simdShuffleDown} and broadcasts with {@code simdBroadcastFirst},
 * so a backend that miscompiles the warp shuffle would compute a wrong answer, silently. OpenCL is
 * such a backend.
 *
 * <p>The shape half is not a preference at all but a hard precondition. The kernel assigns lane
 * {@code L} the head dimensions {@code 2L}, {@code 2L+1}, {@code 64+2L}, {@code 64+2L+1}, which is
 * a correct partition of exactly a 128-wide head across exactly 32 lanes. Anything else is not
 * slower, it is wrong, so the check is an equality and not a heuristic.
 *
 * <h2>Scope</h2>
 *
 * <p>Reached by the Qwen3 FP16 family's split-KV decode attention over an FP16 paged cache. Every
 * other family, every other quantisation, the FP32 key/value cache, the packed-half2 variant and
 * the non-split per-head kernel keep the kernel they had. Head widths other than 128 keep it too,
 * which is what leaves Llama-3.2-1B (64) and the Qwen3.5 family (256) exactly as they were. The
 * FP32-cache variants below are a separate, Metal-only decision.
 *
 * <p>Measured on one device, an RTX 5070 Ti (sm_120). The decision is a backend-level default
 * rather than a per-device measurement, and what it rests on is structural rather than incidental:
 * the kernel it replaces spends 34052 bytes of shared memory per block on a private 128-float
 * accumulator per thread, which caps it at six resident warps per SM of a possible 48, and reaches
 * every one of those floats through a bank all 32 lanes of the warp share.
